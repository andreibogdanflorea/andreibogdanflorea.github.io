#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I have a passion for Machine Learning, with a strong background in Computer Vision in particular. I am a fan of competitive programming, with multiple medals from the Romanian National Olympiad in Informatics obtained in school, and with other distinctions obtained during my Bachelor's.

I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from KU Leuven, graduating top of my class (summa cum laude with congratulations of the Board of Examiners). There, I focused on weakly supervised image segmentation and achieved state-of-the-art results in this topic. Previously, I completed my Bachelor’s Degree at University Politehnica of Bucharest, graduating with a 99% GPA.

During my studies, I accumumlated over a year of experience in the industry as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern, where I developed synthetic data generation pipelines, key for improving the performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and facial landmark detection. I also attended the AI-MAS Machine Learning Summer School and served as an undergraduate teaching assistant for two years.
